Starting a newsletter is like having breakfast. Everybody does it, but in the end you only care about what you have in your plate. 

**Now, how can I convince you to join my breakfast?** Well, the answer is in what I intend to serve. Prime food for thought, crunchy angles, absolutely no mainstream junk. I'd love to be for you like the bacon sandwich served at [St. John Bread & Wine](https://stjohnrestaurant.com/a/restaurants/bread-and-wine), in London ↑: easy and greasy, at least enough for fueling your day and leave a good memory.

"In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power", says Yuval Noah Harari. Take shelter from the deluge, feed you with something you didn't know you could love.

Let's have our first secret breakfast.

### LATEST OBSESSIONS

We all know the world is crazy right now, bad things happen, change must start from each one of us. Well, now let's take a break and let me talk about my latest infatuation for a french stainless steel pan, the coding framework Next.js and food writer Alison Roman. 

#### Alison
At first I hated the idea of Alison just because during Christmas her book [Nothing Fancy](https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Fancy-Unfussy-Having-People-ebook/dp/B07PVW83S9) was reviewed probably in any english language magazine. 

Then [I saw her cooking barefoot in her nano-kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsQt7fHuSfg) for Delish and I started to like her genuine passion more than her [internet-famous chickpea stew](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019772-spiced-chickpea-stew-with-coconut-and-turmeric). Which is delicious by the way. 

Then I read her breakfast recipe in the charity ebook [Family Meal](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/667366/family-meal-by-penguin-random-house/), aka "the book I wanted to write during quarantine and I didn't", and I loved her for her prose.

And even if I keep the anchovies' oil (and she doesn't) or she does hate avocado (and I don't), I really like the way she does her job with her stainless steel pan and I insanely was team Alison when she had [a political correctness catfight](https://www.insider.com/alison-roman-chrissy-teigen-marie-kondo-food-interview-drama-2020-5) with Chrissy Teigen (who won that, to be honest) and Marie Kondo (not particularly sparkling joy, then). 

### The pan
The pan, that's my problem. I don't own a multy layered stainless steel pan (basically a sandwich made of stainless steel, aluminum, and steel again). One reason: I'm afraid it's hard to mantain clean and polished. Reason number two: I wnated to go for an All-Clad  when in the States, and that option is now in pause. That's why here comes the frenchie De Buyer Affinity 32 cm (or the Pentole Agnelli version).
