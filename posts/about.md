#### What is this?
Secret Breakfast is an exclusive food-centered newsletter founded by [Piero Macchioni](https://macchioni.cc). Every week you’ll receive prime food for thought, discover the missing ingredients in your daily life, nibble the crunchy angles that umami our existence in new and dangerous ways.

#### Can you be more specific?
If food is your passion, or maybe is related to your job, with Secret Breakfast you’ll get some lateral thinking about ingredients, tools, trends, people and ideas that can make the difference in our lives. Think about the pinch of salt with your chocolate, the freshly grounded coffee before the brew, think about the details that make the difference every single time. In the way we eat and in the way we live.

#### Aren’t you trying to sell us stuff?
No, I’m not.

#### C’mon…
No. A newsletter is a medium based on trust. And to be trustworthy and build something I need to be 100% free. The newsletter has been chosen to escape the (winning?) living-ad-model we’re experiencing through social media, that is not wrong at all but lacks something if you’re searching for authenticity.

#### I've seen Amazon links, are they clean?
Yes, they are, no affiliation here. I try to link to the original source anytime I can, or independent sellers, but sometimes Azw still offers the best information for the reader (and the most consistent over time).

#### I’m not a cook, I’m not a foodie, why should I subscribe?
Well, they say that wherever you go, food and sky will always follow you. What we eat is part of the world we grow. What we share at the table is how we take care of the people we love. Food, ultimately, is a way to understand better people, places, memories, desires. And, as I see it, a way to enjoy life.

#### Will Secret Breakfast be free?
We’re starting free with the dream of building a passionate community. We hope we'll grow, we’ll listen to you. We’ll pivot, if necessary.

#### Who am I giving my email address?
Privacy and legal stuff are [here](https://emailoctopus.com/legal/privacy), via Email Octopus. The ball, you see, will be always in your hand. We hope you give us a chance, accept the invitation to our Secret Breakfast and, if you like it, tell your friends.

#### Who are you?
This is [Piero Macchioni](https://macchioni.cc), journalist, food maniac, fermenting mind, open web believer and passionate about [article 15](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libert%C3%A0_e_segretezza_della_corrispondenza) of the Italian Constitution.

#### One last thing: why do you say Secret Breakfast is an ice-cream flavor?
Secret Breakfast is the name of one of the bestseller gelatos at Humphry Slocombe’s, in San Francisco, USA. You should Google that and find a way to get a pint (no ads here, just a friendly suggestion).
