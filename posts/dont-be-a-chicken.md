Hi there!

A few weeks ago I bought some fine 100% criollo cocoa chocolate from Venezuela. It's bitter, it's fruity, it drains your mouth and makes you wonder: "If this is real chocolate, and it is.. Do I really like real chocolate?". 

You can  change the above questions and doubt about the 80-95% of the coffee/meat/fish/flour you've ever had in your life. Good things taste different, we all know that. But sometimes we cheat time with a compromise: bad coffee for an evening with good friends, standard meat for a quick lunch, sweet chocolate at night to cope with depressing sex life. 

That's substance. 

And then there's appearance. Now that we have "impossible burgers" and lab-grown-chicken (read more in the article below)  I wonder: why do we need surrogates of real meat? The answer I gave to me is: because we need to help some transition from a primitive world to a more sustainable one. 

That reminded me the earliest iPhone, year 2007. The user interface then was based on skeuomorphism, the design concept of making items represented resemble their real-world counterparts: the book library app was "made" of wooden shelves and book covers, you took notes on yellow notepads and so on. 

We need the appearance to soften the jump into the void represented by cultural changes like eating less meat, or no meat at all. 

That said, I've never loved skeuomorphism. I don't like fake soft boiled eggs made molding coconut, agar agar and mango. I don't like the idea of vegetarian sausages or hamburgers, even if this business is flourishing. I always had goosebumps when reading recipes like "zucchini carbonara". But that's me. 

My wish is that we could get substance without mind-gaming ourselves with appearance. That doesn't mean that food mustn't be beautiful, that just means we have a new challenge: rediscovering food as it is, as pure as it can be. Like that chocolate that hasn't melt in my mouth, but that could be the beginning of an unexpected beautiful foodie-friendship.
