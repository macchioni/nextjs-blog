### An exclusive newsletter, the best place to start your day and maybe roast a rice cake while waiting for the next big wave

Hi there!

It's almost Christmas time and I've found my spiritual epiphany reading [this New York Times story about a 1020 years old mochi shop](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/business/japan-old-companies.html). Bear with me, I won't talk about rice cakes, but about the meaning of one's existence.

Ichiwa is a Kyoto family business that survived war, famine, and you name any other crisis you want. Today, less than one year of Covid-19 is destroying companies from Alaska to Fiji, but apparently these Japanese guys resisted even worse. Why? 

‚ÄãAre they "safe" just because they're too small to fail? Are they alive because they're sacrificing wealth to their mission to keep themselves over the water?

Their business model is not maximizing profits, scaling up, getting more market share. Their number one priority is carrying on, pass the baton to the next generation. Naomi Hasegawa, the lady pictured above, thinks **a business cannot just chase profits, it has to have a higher purpose**. In this case, serving the shrine‚Äôs pilgrims. 

This remindend me a book by Pearl S. Buck (see quote below), and  families that, decade after decade, know success and failure, money and hunger, love and pain. But they always stayed on their land, building and rebuilding, flood after flood.

After 2020, we will go back to the places of our memories and maybe we will not find them anymore. Swept away from the pandemic wave. But some will survive, having sacrificed wealth, personal health, nights of sleep. 

They will have saved their land, their food. They will have saved our memories. And our future too.  

Piero
