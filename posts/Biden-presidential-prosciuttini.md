Hi there!

First of all, thank you: I’m really moved by your response to this humble newsletter. But why keep you waiting, let’s brew some breakfast. 

The man of the hour is Joe Biden, president-elect of the United States. I won’t talk politics here, but wait: the guy has been the Delaware senator from 1973 to 2009, and he might know some hot spots in his constituency we may have missed. Think about  [Freddy’s BBQ Joint](https://houseofcards.fandom.com/wiki/Freddy%27s_BBQ_Joint)  in *House of Cards* and you get the idea.

I dug  [an old Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2013/11/21/joe-biden-talks-delawares-sandwiches-filibuster/)  and… Bingo! What about this  [Capriotti’s Sandwich Shop](https://www.capriottis.com/) , in Wilmington? The now un-average Joe goes for two:
* **Medium Italian** with hot peppers: “A flavorful combination of premium Italian deli meats made with Genoa salami, capicola, and prosciuttini” (note that in italian you spell: “salame”, “capocollo” and “prosciutto”).
* **Large Bobbie,**presented as “The nationally acclaimed best-seller! Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo” (nothing to object about this one).
The other Joe’s venue to remember is this  [Charcoal Pit](http://www.charcoalpit.net/) , “Home of the original 1/4 pound hamburger”, where Barack Obama had a cheeseburger and where Joe Biden is said to like a  [thick and lumpy black-and-white milkshake](https://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/foodnews/everybody-knows-joe-i-ate-at-biden-s-favorite-hometown-restaurants/ar-BB1axHsF) .

It’s safe to say that if Biden’s coronary arteries resisted days of vote-counting and years of Medium Italian with hot peppers, maybe he can survive four more years. And hopefully even the United States can survive years like the four we lived. 

God bless you and your prosciuttini, Delaware Joe, enjoy the rest of this thick and lumpy Secret Breakfast.

Piero
