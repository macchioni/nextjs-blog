## Welcome to Secret Breakfast

### An exclusive newsletter, the best place to start your day and talk about haute couture and Thanksgiving (the Japanese one)

Hi there!

Somewhere in the world is going to be Thanksgiving soon and people will finally have the occasion to cook something at home (🥁 Covid-19 sarcasm drumroll, please). But before all that, we must talk about haute couture and hamburgers, chefs and designers.

I’ve been triggered on Sunday by  [the Washington Post profile of Pierpaolo Piccioli](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/11/16/valentino-pierpaolo-piccioli-high-fashion/?arc404=true) , creative director for Valentino. He’s one of the best people you can quote in the fashion industry right now, he’s smart, his couture makes you dream even in difficult times, he has something to say. He’s, in other terms, a three-star chef who doesn’t cook.

Fashion right now is in deep shit like the hospitality industry. So you have to have a vision stronger than fate to keep yourself alive. What is Piccioli’s vision? He says many important things but three stand out:

>«Beauty in the past was linked to the surface. It was an idea of physical attributes — everyone with the same physical attributes. Today, beauty is about the idea of grace».

> «I’m not interested in just delivering clothes. It’s to be a witness of my times».

>«Your world has to be inclusive so you don’t have to [check] the boxes when you do the show. Inclusivity is part of life».

If you’re half crazy than me, now you’re thinking to a real three-star chef: Noma’s René Redzepi. After this pandemic-summer-burger-experiment  [he’s opening a real burger shop in Copenhagen, Denmark](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/22/hold-the-18-course-dinners-noma-chef-opens-up-a-burger-joint) . We all know that now, with no tourists, “$400 per person restaurants” have almost zero reasons to exist. Even comfort food joints are struggling. 

I do not know if Redzepi is loving the burger spin-off. I read his quotes and I feel him sad: «I didn’t know it was important to me that everyone could have access to our food», he says. Anyway, he somehow ticked all the Piccioli’s boxes: 

* Bring beauty out of the surface.
* Be a witness of his times. 
* Be inclusive (yes, vegan burger on the menu).

The latest Piccioli’s lesson will be the most difficult to learn, for any chef or restaurant owner or just person in the world:

> «Lifestyle is definitely an old word for me. I like for today the idea of community. I wanted to change the idea of Valentino as an exclusive brand to be an inclusive brand — but keeping the values of the house, which is in couture and romance».  

We all need some romance, right now. Happy Thanksgiving.

Piero
