## Welcome to Secret Breakfast

### An exclusive newsletter, the best place for starting your day and then think: "the shorter the menu, the better"

Hi there!

I started thinking about 2021. I already have  [my bullet journal](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_ice_webnotebook.php)  ready for next year and I even attended a special Shawn Blanc‚Äôs webinar. Blanc is an honest media guy that has  [an effective method](https://thefocuscourse.com/plan-your-year/)  of getting things done and planning your days. He gave me two takeouts that somehow can be useful in our kitchen or in our life. 

**One: find your sweet spot**
There are the things you care about (your vision, values and goals) and there are your resources (your time, attention, energy). When these two areas meet, you have the sweet spot: the place where you dedicate yourself to the things you love. The challenge,  [as Shawn puts it](https://vimeo.com/476392331) , is: how do you do that? Answer: *you have to get clear and you have to get going*. Like a f****ng samurai kitchen.

**Two: Warren Buffet‚Äôs 25/5 rule**
That‚Äôs old, but still good. The short version is: make a list of the 25 goals you want to reach in your life. Then make a list starting from the most important to the last. Then, tear apart the piece of paper: keep the top 5, trash the other 20. Because those 20 bastards are distracting you from reaching your top 5. And that makes sense: do you trust more a restaurant with dozens of average plates on the menu or a place that bet on half a dozen masterpieces?
If you‚Äôre looking for the long version of this wealthy businessman‚Äôs trick, go  [here](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/i-just-discovered-warren-buffets-25-5-rule-completely-brilliant.html) .

And take care!

Piero

PS: Sorry, I used good old Gordon tearing a menu apart, but this portrait always works.
