## Welcome to Secret Breakfast

### An exclusive newsletter, the best place to start your day and stand right in the middle of your empty restaurant, because it's  Christmas, the year is almost over, but it's still f*****g 2020

Hi there!

You can look for billions of pictures and get an idea of what 2020 has been. But if you only could choose one for the food world, why not the one above?

[John Carey](https://www.instagram.com/johncareyphoto/) is a British photographer specialized in restaurants. His world was made by chefs incapable of standing still, places with perfect lights and astonishing dishes, brilliant colors and laughs. Then came the lockdown. All his works canceled or postponed. All the restaurants closed.

He started this **#lockdownportraits** series: chefs portrayed as still as possible in their empty restaurants. Lights almost off, grainy black and white. Many of them are staring through the windows. You feel a sense of impotence, a creative void, but also some hidden strength ready to explode as soon as these pandemic days will be over. 

I asked John to pick a photo representing this project. He kindly opted for the one above: ¬´[John Williams](https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/meet-aa-chef-year-john-13816500) at The Ritz, an iconic London establishment, a place that was open during the Second World War but couldn't function in this crisis¬ª, he wrote me right after we knew about the new Covid strain.

I want to be positive, today.

*Every battle is won or lost before it is ever fought*, wrote Sun Tzu in _The Art of War_. We've not said that enough in the past weeks, but we've won this one, the pandemic war, since day one. We've won locking ourselves up, pressing the pause button on our hectic lives and immediate aspirations, by saying goodbye to our fragile loved ones, our jobs, our way of living.

We've lost so much. But we're winning, because vaccines are coming and sacrifices were made and no strain can possibly stop us. **Because we've been standing vulnerable like chef John Williams while our house was our trench**. New battles will be fought, that's for sure. We may win them all, again. 

Christmas is about being born. My dearest wishes to you all. 

Let's all be reborn.

Piero
