## Welcome to Secret Breakfast

### An exclusive newsletter, the best place to start your day and... Wait! Is that a dildo in your kitchen, or are you just happy to see me?

Hi there!

I was happy this newsletter survived its first month. I was so happy I decided to risk a mass unsubscribing and go full  [Mugaritz](https://www.mugaritz.com/) -y, that means talking about two things: big questions and obscenity. 

**”Change”** is a word buzzing since Obama 2008. They tell you that change is good even when it’s bad. Change is necessary in a Covid-19 world. And they’re right. Change is real, sometimes too much. **But what kind of change is strong enough to rewrite the rules in the way we need?**

It came to my mind something told by music entrepreneur  [Derek Sivers](https://open.spotify.com/show/7cnrLotBo3valxteAfZO3H?si=WB6Wkr_0SJKmlkOsCfYezg)  about **remixing**: «Save a copy of whatever you’re working on, and then go mess with the copy. Like, reverse it. Turn it inside out. Chop the middle. Extend the ends. And then save another copy and on this new copy, now twist it and question it and put some poison in it. Kill its crucial component». And then he went on and on. 

That’s a change for sure. Then we have another kind of change: **misplacing**. Take a tool, bring it to a new place, use it for a different purpose. Like I do it here: bring a blog into an email and you have a newsletter. Like chef Andoni Luis Aduriz does at Mugaritz: buy some dildos, use them to model something new, like the serving you see in the picture above. That’s the obscenity. 

That’s new. That’s change. Is that the kind of change you were expecting? What change can we expect from you?

**PS**: the plate in the picture is “ [Goma de lácteos](https://www.mugaritz.com/es/goma-de-lacteos/fo-1520008091/) ”, presented as an anthem of sensuality. It’s been described as a jelly condom full of a Scandinavian milky ferment. Oh, it is what it is. 

**PPS**: thanks to some SEO genius we’re in a pretty good spot on  [InboxReads](https://inboxreads.co/) , a directory of wonderful newsletters.
