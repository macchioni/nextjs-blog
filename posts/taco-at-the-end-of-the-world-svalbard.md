## Welcome to Secret Breakfast

### An exclusive newsletter, the best place to start your day and get a taco at the end of the world

![Taco Svalbard](https://gallery.eomail5.com/2f942933-0bf5-11eb-a3d0-06b4694bee2a%2F1609167799537-Invio.jpg)

Hi there!

As we're leaving the year 2020 for good, I just wanted to keep this intro very short and wish you all **the courage to believe again in the unexpected**. 

We've passed 12 months coping with the effects of an unexpected pandemic. During early 2021 we'll probably do the same. Most of us will only wish for some boring peaceful time, no shocks, no jumps into the void, no surprises.

Well, on the contrary, my wish for you is to keep longing for the unexpected. And no image could explain better my wish than a taco truck serving Mexican food at 2 am at  Svalbard, while outside the temperature is -30¬∞ C. 

The picture is part of a self-published book by Italian photographer Isacco Emiliani: [No Man's Land Svalbard - Arctic Visions](https://www.isaccoemiliani.com/categoria-prodotto/libri/). He has been traveling to the most extreme regions to show the relationship between man and nature.  

The picture above is not his best shot for sure, but is telling me something clearly: believe the impossible. **Don't stop searching for comfort and surprise, for love and human touch. Whenever you find people, wherever you find food**. 

Happy unexpected 2021 to you all. Love,

Piero

PS: Isacco Emiliani was kind enough to concede the use of his work, check him out on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/isaccoemiliani/) or via his [website](https://www.isaccoemiliani.com/). For any book sold he'll donate to plant five trees with [Trees For The Future](https://trees.org/).
