Starting a newsletter is like having breakfast. Everybody does it, but in the end you only care about what you have in your plate.

**Now, how can I convince you to join this breakfast?** Well, the answer is in what I intend to serve. Prime food for thought, crunchy angles, absolutely no mainstream junk. I'd love to be for you like the bacon sandwich served at [St. John Bread & Wine](https://stjohnrestaurant.com/a/restaurants/bread-and-wine), in London ‚Üë: easy and greasy, at least enough for fueling your day and leave a good memory.

"In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power", says Yuval Noah Harari. Take shelter from the deluge, feed you with something you didn't know you could love.

Let's have our first secret breakfast.

### THREE OBSESSIONS üë©‚Äçüç≥+üç≥+üíª

We all know the world is crazy right now, bad things happen, change must start from each one of us. Well, now let's take a break and let me talk about my latest infatuation for a french stainless steel pan, the coding framework Next.js and food writer Alison Roman. Let's start with her.

#### Alison, why did I miss her?
At first I hated the idea of Alison just because during Christmas her book [Nothing Fancy](https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Fancy-Unfussy-Having-People-ebook/dp/B07PVW83S9) was reviewed probably in any english language magazine.

Then [I saw her cooking barefoot in her nano-kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsQt7fHuSfg) for Delish and I started to like her genuine passion more than her [internet-famous chickpea stew](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019772-spiced-chickpea-stew-with-coconut-and-turmeric). Which is delicious by the way.

Then I read her breakfast recipe in the charity ebook [Family Meal](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/667366/family-meal-by-penguin-random-house/), aka "the book I wanted to write during quarantine and I didn't", and I loved her for her prose. So I subscribed to [her newsletter](https://www.alisoneroman.com/newsletter) and my weeks are just better.

And even if I keep the anchovies' oil (and she doesn't) or she does hate avocado (and I don't), I really like the way she does her job (mostly with a stainless steel pan) and I insanely was team Alison when she had [a political correctness catfight](https://www.insider.com/alison-roman-chrissy-teigen-marie-kondo-food-interview-drama-2020-5) with Chrissy Teigen (Teigen won that, to be honest) and Marie Kondo (not particularly sparkling joy, at the time).
<br />


#### The pan I haven't bought. Yet.
The pan, that's my problem. I do not own a multi-layered stainless steel pan (basically a sandwich made of stainless steel, aluminum, and steel again).

One reason: I'm afraid it's hard to maintain clean and polished. Reason number two: I wanted to go for an All-Clad when in the States, and that option is now on pause. That's why here comes the frenchie [De Buyer Affinity 32 cm](https://www.debuyer-brandshop.com/de-Buyer-Stainless-Steel-Frypan-32-cm-AFFINITY), or the italian [Pentole Agnelli](https://www.pentoleagnelli.it/index.php/linee/acciaio-inox-18-10/linea-acciaio-inox-18-10) version, or the [Mauviel M'cook 28 cm](https://www.amazon.com/Mauviel-5242-28-Non-Stick-Non-Stick-Stainless/dp/B00J58O5EK), that is my personal favorite now.

#### What is Next.js?
It's a React framework, basically a way to build fast websites and web apps. I played a bit and built this site with [NEXT.JS](https://nextjs.org/). Do you need to learn it? No, of course.
